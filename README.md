Challenges Faced

-MongoDB Connection Struggled with the connection string and environment variables. Learned to verify .env paths and enable network access in Atlas.

-npm run dev Issues

Encountered errors when running both servers concurrently. Fixed by installing nodemon globally and ensuring no port conflicts.

-Page Alignment & Styling

Aligning product cards and grid responsiveness was tricky. Solved by tweaking Tailwind utility classes and using Flexbox.

-Live Dummy JSON API Integrating a placeholder API for cart & products (dummyjson) introduced CORS issues. Resolved by adding CORS middleware and correct request headers.

-Future Improvements

Add user authentication (register/login) Build an Admin panel for product CRUD Implement real-time stock updates with Socket.io and more..
